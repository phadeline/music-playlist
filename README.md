# Musicplaylist 

## Description
For this project (*Module 07: Porject 1 Week 1*), students were instructed to builf a web application from scratch. With a team, we conveiced and executed a design that solves some form of a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Our group chose to focus on music and it's ability to produce emotions with the right playlist. There are many times when people try to create a playlist but don't know where to start, that is where our web application comes into play. Users can search songs and artists and listen to just 30 second previews of the song so they can begin to build their ultimate playlist for either a night in by themselves or the biggest party they'll be throwing.

**User Story** 
- AS an everyday User
- I WANT an interactive front-end application 
- SO THAT I can create playlist on the go without having a listen to an entire song or use multiple music streaming services

**Acceptance Criteria** 
- GIVEN a webpage meets the User Story
- WHEN I use a CSS frameowrk to create an easy to use layout
- THEN I find a framework other than Bootstrap
- WHEN I use the search bar 
- THEN I find that two server-side api are being used simultaneous to get music results
- WHEN I view the songs
- THEN I can listen to a preview of them
- WHEN I drag the songs cards to the playlist column
- THEN they stay they stay in the playlist section even if the page is closed and reloaded
- WHEN I view the songs in the playlist column
- THEN I find I can remove the song from my playlist if I no longer want it

## Technologies Used
Two server-side APIs were used to obtain music results: **Deezer API** and **Itunes API**.

## Usage
To use the web application, simply use the search bar by entering a song title or an artist name then hit enter. The page will then load a list of sings in the Deezer column and the Itunes column for the user to listen to previews of the songs. Based on the songs that the user likes, they can drag and drop their favorite songs into the playlist column where it will save in locale storage. To drag the songs and drop them into the playlist column, the user will drag the song card directly to where it says "Your Playlist" in green text. The user can then continue to search for more songs and continue to add them to their playlist. If they do want a song in their playlist anymore, they can click on the remove button under the song and the song will be removed from their playlist. 

Here is a video to see how the application is used:
